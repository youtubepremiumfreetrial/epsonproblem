Common Epson Printer Issues
----------------------------

1. **Printer Not Printing**
   - Make sure the printer is turned on and connected properly to your computer or network.
   - Check for error messages on the printer display.
   - Ensure you’ve installed the correct printer driver for your model.

2. **Paper Jam**
   - Turn off the printer and gently remove any jammed paper from the tray or back panel.
   - Check the rollers for small pieces of torn paper.
   - Reload the paper properly and avoid overfilling the tray.

3. **Wi-Fi Connection Issues**
   - Verify that your printer and computer/mobile device are on the same wireless network.
   - Restart your router and printer to refresh the connection.
   - Use the **Epson Printer Setup Utility** to reconnect to Wi-Fi if needed.

4. **Poor Print Quality**
   - Clean the printhead using your printer’s maintenance tools.
   - Make sure you're using the right type of paper and print settings.
   - Replace low or empty ink cartridges.

5. **Printer Offline**
   - On Windows, go to **Devices and Printers**, right-click your printer, and select **Use Printer Online**.
   - On macOS, remove and re-add the printer from **System Preferences > Printers & Scanners**.
   - Ensure there are no pending print jobs causing the spooler to freeze.
